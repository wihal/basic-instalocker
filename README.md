## FAQ 🔍
- **What is Instalocking?**
If you are on this site your properly know what is Instalocking but for people who dont know:
> Instalocking is a practice in Valorant where a player selects their favourite Agent as soon as possible when they enter a lobby. This is to ensure that you can play your favourite agent before anyone else has a chance to select it. The program just automates this process.

- **Why is my antivirus blocking Agent Picker?**
> **It's safe**, the computer may think its a virus because the program is access your mouse to instalock not like another instalocker which are access the client api like [this project from @deadly](https://github.com/deadly/valorant-agent-yoinker), it a you can check the source code and compile it yourself, you will get the same result.  For more information about potential false positives in instalocking tools, see the wiki
 [Virus Detection and False Positives](https://github.com/willi6392/valorant-instalocker-with-gui/wiki/Virus%3F).

- **Can I get banned for using a Instalocker?**
> It's **unlikely** to get banned by using an instalocker, as the instalocker does not read the game's memory or make changes to the game's files, nor does it abuse the Valorant API. **I do not guarantee that it is not bannable!**
