## What is Instalocking?
If you are on this site your properly know what is Instalocking but for people who dont know:
> Instalocking is a practice in Valorant where a player selects their favourite Agent as soon as possible when they enter a lobby. This is to ensure that you can play your favourite agent before anyone else has a chance to select it. The program just automates this process.
